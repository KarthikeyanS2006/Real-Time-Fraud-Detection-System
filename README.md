# üõ°Ô∏è Real-Time Fraud Detection System for Digital Payments üí≥

## Naan Mudhalvan Project (Project 20)

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and trained models for an AI-powered real-time fraud detection system designed for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC) and FinTech operations.

The system uses advanced Machine Learning algorithms (XGBoost) and behavioral analytics to monitor and score digital payment transactions with low latency, proactively preventing financial crime.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The core problem addressed is the high velocity and constantly evolving nature of digital payment fraud, which overwhelms traditional rule-based systems.

**Solution:** A streaming architecture mock-up utilizing velocity features (e.g., transactions per hour) and a cost-sensitive **XGBoost Classifier** to achieve high Recall (catching fraud) while maintaining low latency.

**Key Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Joblib.
